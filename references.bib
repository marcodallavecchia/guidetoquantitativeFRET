abstract = {F{\"{o}}rster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) allows for the visualization of nanometer-scale distances and distance changes. This sensitivity is regularly achieved in single-molecule experiments in vitro but is still challenging in biological materials. Despite many efforts, quantitative FRET in living samples is either restricted to specific instruments or limited by the complexity of the required analysis. With the recent development and expanding utilization of FRET-based biosensors, it becomes essential to allow biologists to produce quantitative results that can directly be compared. Here, we present a new calibration and analysis method allowing for quantitative FRET imaging in living cells with a simple fluorescence microscope. Aside from the spectral crosstalk corrections, two additional correction factors were defined from photophysical equations, describing the relative differences in excitation and detection efficiencies. The calibration is achieved in a single step, which renders the Quantitative Three-Image FRET (QuanTI-FRET) method extremely robust. The only requirement is a sample of known stoichiometry donor:acceptor, which is naturally the case for intramolecular FRET constructs. We show that QuanTI-FRET gives absolute FRET values, independent of the instrument or the expression level. Through the calculation of the stoichiometry, we assess the quality of the data thus making QuanTI-FRET usable confidently by non-specialists.},

abstract = {Single-molecule F{\"{o}}rster resonance energy transfer (smFRET) is increasingly being used to determine distances, structures, and dynamics of biomolecules in vitro and in vivo. However, generalized protocols and FRET standards to ensure the reproducibility and accuracy of measurements of FRET efficiencies are currently lacking. Here we report the results of a comparative blind study in which 20 labs determined the FRET efficiencies (E) of several dye-labeled DNA duplexes. Using a unified, straightforward method, we obtained FRET efficiencies with s.d. between ±0.02 and ±0.05. We suggest experimental and computational procedures for converting FRET efficiencies into accurate distances, and discuss potential uncertainties in the experiment and the modeling. Our quantitative assessment of the reproducibility of intensity-based smFRET measurements and a unified correction procedure represents an important step toward the validation of distance networks, with the ultimate aim of achieving reliable structural models of biomolecular systems by smFRET-based hybrid methods.},

@article{Roebroek2021,
abstract = {F{\"{o}}rster resonant energy transfer (FRET) is a powerful mechanism to probe associations in situ. Simultaneously performing more than one FRET measurement can be challenging due to the spectral bandwidth required for the donor and acceptor fluorophores. We present an approach to distinguish overlapping FRET pairs based on the photochromism of the donor fluorophores, even if the involved fluorophores display essentially identical absorption and emission spectra. We develop the theory underlying this method and validate our approach using numerical simulations. To apply our system, we develop rsAKARev, a photochromic biosensor for cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA), and combine it with the spectrally-identical biosensor EKARev, a reporter for extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activity, to deliver simultaneous readout of both activities in the same cell. We further perform multiplexed PKA, ERK, and calcium measurements by including a third, spectrally-shifted biosensor. Our work demonstrates that exploiting donor photochromism in FRET can be a powerful approach to simultaneously read out multiple associations within living cells.},

@article{Gordon1998,
abstract = {Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) is a technique used for quantifying the distance between two molecules conjugated to different fluorophores. By combining optical microscopy with FRET it is possible to obtain quantitative temporal and spatial information about the binding and interaction of proteins, lipids, enzymes, DNA, and RNA in vivo. In conjunction with the recent development of a variety of mutant green fluorescent proteins (mtGFPs), FRET microscopy provides the potential to measure the interaction of intracellular molecular species in intact living cells where the donor and acceptor fluorophores are actually part of the molecules themselves. However, steady-state FRET microscopy measurements can suffer from several sources of distortion, which need to be corrected. These include direct excitation of the acceptor at the donor excitation wavelengths and the dependence of FRET on the concentration of acceptor. We present a simple method for the analysis of FRET data obtained with standard filter sets in a fluorescence microscope. This method is corrected for cross talk (any detection of donor fluorescence with the acceptor emission filter and any detection of acceptor fluorescence with the donor emission filter), and for the dependence of FRET on the concentrations of the donor and acceptor. Measurements of the interaction of the proteins Bcl-2 and Beclin (a recently identified Bcl-2 interacting protein located on chromosome 17q21), are shown to document the accuracy of this approach for correction of donor and acceptor concentrations, and cross talk between the different filter units.},

@article{Zal2004,
abstract = {Fluorescent resonance energy transfer (FRET) imaging techniques can be used to visualize protein-protein interactions in real-time with subcellular resolution. Imaging of sensitized fluorescence of the acceptor, elicited during excitation of the donor, is becoming the most popular method for live FRET (3-cube imaging) because it is fast, nondestructive, and applicable to existing widefield or confocal microscopes. Most sensitized emission-based FRET indices respond nonlinearly to changes in the degree of molecular interaction and depend on the optical parameters of the imaging system. This makes it difficult to evaluate and compare FRET imaging data between laboratories. Furthermore, photobleaching poses a problem for FRET imaging in timelapse experiments and three-dimensional reconstructions. We present a 3-cube FRET imaging method, E-FRET, which overcomes both of these obstacles. E-FRET bridges the gap between the donor recovery after acceptor photobleaching technique (which allows absolute measurements of FRET efficiency, E, but is not suitable for living cells), and the sensitized-emission FRET indices (which reflect FRET in living cells but lack the quantitation and clarity of E). With E-FRET, we visualize FRET in terms of true FRET efficiency images (E), which correlate linearly with the degree of donor interaction. We have defined procedures to incorporate photobleaching correction into E-FRET imaging. We demonstrate the benefits of E-FRET with photobleaching correction for timelapse and three-dimensional imaging of protein-protein interactions in the immunological synapse in living T-cells.},
